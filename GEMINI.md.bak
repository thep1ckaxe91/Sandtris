# Sandtris: Refactor for Performance - Technical Guide

## 1. Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to refactor the Sandtris game to significantly improve its performance and scalability, allowing it to simulate a much larger number of sand particles at a higher resolution. A secondary goal is to modernize the C++ codebase to align with current best practices.

## 2. Core Refactoring Areas

Based on the initial analysis, the following areas are the main focus for refactoring:

### 2.1. Memory Management (High Priority)

*   **Objective:** Eliminate manual memory management to prevent memory leaks and improve code safety.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   Replace raw `new` and `delete` with `std::unique_ptr` for all `Scene` and `SceneTransition` objects within the `Game` class. The `Game` class is the single owner of these objects.
    *   Audit the rest of the codebase for any other raw pointer usage and replace it with appropriate smart pointers.

### 2.2. Sand Simulation Algorithm (High Priority)

*   **Objective:** Optimize the sand simulation logic in the `Grid` class to handle a massive number of particles.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   Analyze the current `step()` function in the `Grid` class for performance bottlenecks.
    *   Investigate more efficient algorithms for updating the sand particles, such as chunking the grid and only updating active chunks.
    *   Profile the application to identify the most time-consuming parts of the simulation.

### 2.3. Multithreading (Medium Priority)

*   **Objective:** Implement an efficient multithreading strategy for the grid update.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   Remove the existing `#ifdef MULTITHREADING` implementation.
    *   Design and implement a more robust and efficient multithreading model. A thread pool that processes chunks of the grid could be a good approach.
    *   Ensure that the multithreading implementation is thread-safe and does not introduce race conditions.

### 2.4. Code Modernization (Medium Priority)

*   **Objective:** Bring the codebase up to modern C++ standards.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   Replace all instances of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific headers.
    *   Remove all `using namespace std;` from header files. Qualify names with `std::` or use `using` declarations in `.cpp` files.
    *   Replace all Windows-specific path constructions (e.g., `"data\fonts\"`) with `std::filesystem::path` to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
    *   Standardize I/O operations to use C++ streams (`std::cout`, `std::cerr`) instead of C-style functions (`printf`).

## 3. Build and Run Instructions

The project is built using CMake.

1.  **Configure:** `cmake -B build`
2.  **Build:** `cmake --build build`
3.  **Run:** `./build/Debug/Sandtris` (or similar, depending on the build type and target name)

This document should be used as a guide for all future development on this project.

## 4. Architecture Mandates (as of 2025-12-10)

These mandates are from a `SYSTEM_CONTEXT_UPDATE` and take precedence over the general guidelines above where conflicts exist.

*   **Role**: Senior Systems Engineer / C++ Performance Specialist.
*   **Project**: Sandtris (Refactoring Legacy C++ to Modern Systems C++20).

### 4.1. Build System
*   CMake with explicit source lists. No GLOBs.

### 4.2. Library
*   SDL3 (Not SDL2).

### 4.3. Memory Management
*   RAII enforcement. No raw 'new/delete'.
*   Use `std::unique_ptr` with custom deleters for SDL resources.

### 4.4. Performance Strategy
*   **Rendering**: DO NOT use `SDL_RenderPoint`. Use `SDL_LockTexture` + direct buffer manipulation (`uint32_t` array).
*   **Physics**: Iterate 1D memory linearly (cache-friendly) rather than naive 2D array access.
*   **Input**: Zero-allocation. Manipulate `Tetromino` structs (stack memory), do not create Surfaces for rotating pieces.

## 5. Current Task

*   **Task**: Implement `SandGrid::draw` (Texture Locking) and `SandGrid::updatePhysics` (Linear Scan).
*   **Goal**: Move from Tier 4 (Student Code) to Tier 2 (High-Performance Systems Code).
